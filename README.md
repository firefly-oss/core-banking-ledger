## Overview

The Core Banking Ledger is a transaction management system that provides a robust foundation for financial operations. It implements double-entry accounting principles, supports various transaction types including cryptocurrency transactions, and ensures regulatory compliance while maintaining high performance and reliability.

> **Note**: Transaction categories are now managed in an external master data microservice. The `transactionCategoryId` field in the Transaction entity serves as a logical reference to categories in this external service.

## üöÄ Quickstart

### Prerequisites
- JDK 21
- Maven 3.8+
- Docker (for containerized deployment)

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/firefly-oss/core-banking-ledger.git
cd core-banking-ledger

# Build the project
mvn clean install

# Run the application
mvn spring-boot:run -pl core-banking-ledger-web
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build the Docker image
mvn clean package
docker build -t core-banking-ledger:latest .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8080:8080 core-banking-ledger:latest
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The Core Banking Ledger is designed as a modular, microservice-based system with a clear separation of concerns following domain-driven design principles. The architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and resilience.

### Module Structure

- **core-banking-ledger-interfaces**: Contains all API contracts, Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), and enumerations that define the public interface of the system. This module has minimal dependencies and serves as the contract between the system and its clients.

- **core-banking-ledger-models**: Defines the data entities, repository interfaces, and database migrations. This module encapsulates the persistence layer and data access patterns, using R2DBC for reactive database access.

- **core-banking-ledger-core**: Implements the business logic and service layer. This module contains the core domain logic, transaction processing rules, and service implementations. It follows the hexagonal architecture pattern with clear boundaries between the domain model and external dependencies.

- **core-banking-ledger-web**: Provides the REST API endpoints and controllers that expose the system's functionality to clients. This module handles HTTP requests, input validation, and response formatting, delegating business logic to the core module.


### Key Components

#### Transaction Processing Engine

The transaction processing engine is the heart of the Core Banking Ledger system. It handles various types of financial transactions with specialized processing logic for each type:

- **Card Transactions**: Processes debit and credit card payments with merchant details, authorization codes, and fraud detection flags.
- **Direct Debit Operations**: Manages automated payments to vendors with mandate information and sequence types.
- **SEPA Transfers**: Handles European payment transfers with IBAN/BIC validation and SEPA-specific fields.
- **Wire Transfers**: Processes international wire transfers with SWIFT codes and cross-border compliance checks.
- **Standing Orders**: Manages recurring scheduled payments with frequency and execution tracking.
- **Deposit Transactions**: Records cash or check deposits with detailed source information.
- **Withdrawal Transactions**: Records cash withdrawals with ATM or branch details and limit checks.
- **Fee Transactions**: Manages various banking fees with calculation methods and waiver tracking.
- **Interest Transactions**: Calculates and applies interest payments or charges with accrual periods.
- **Transfer Transactions**: Handles internal transfers between accounts with purpose codes.
- **Cryptocurrency Transactions**: Processes cryptocurrency deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and swaps with blockchain integration.
- **Token Operations**: Manages token minting, burning, and transfers, including NFT transactions.
- **Staking Operations**: Handles cryptocurrency staking, unstaking, and reward distribution.

#### Blockchain Integration Framework

The system includes a comprehensive blockchain integration framework for interacting with various blockchain networks:

- **Blockchain Network Management**: Supports multiple blockchain networks (Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.) with network-specific configurations.
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Listens for blockchain events like deposits, token transfers, and smart contract events.
- **Transaction Broadcasting**: Sends transactions to blockchain networks with proper gas fee estimation.
- **Confirmation Tracking**: Monitors transaction confirmations and updates transaction status accordingly.
- **Address Management**: Registers and monitors blockchain addresses for incoming transactions.
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Interacts with smart contracts for token operations and other blockchain functions.

#### Double-Entry Accounting System

The system implements proper double-entry accounting principles to ensure financial integrity:

- **Transaction Legs**: Each transaction consists of at least two legs (debit and credit) that always balance to zero.
- **Balance Calculation**: Account balances are calculated based on the sum of transaction legs.
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Handles transactions in different currencies with proper exchange rate tracking.
- **Multi-Asset Support**: Supports both fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies with proper accounting.
- **Booking vs. Value Date**: Distinguishes between when a transaction is booked and when it affects interest calculations.

#### Event-Driven Integration Framework

The system uses an event-driven architecture for reliable integration with other systems:

- **Event Outbox Pattern**: Ensures reliable event publishing even in the face of failures.
- **Domain Events**: Publishes events for transaction lifecycle (created, updated, status changed).
- **Idempotent Processing**: Prevents duplicate transactions with unique external references and request IDs.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Enables loose coupling between services through event-based integration.
- **Blockchain Event Processing**: Processes blockchain events asynchronously to update transaction status.

#### Transaction Relationship Management

The system tracks relationships between transactions for comprehensive financial history:

- **Related Transactions**: Links transactions that are related (e.g., original transaction and its reversal).
- **Relation Types**: Categorizes relationships as reversals, adjustments, chargebacks, or corrections.
- **Batch Processing**: Groups related transactions with batch IDs for bulk operations.
- **Audit Trail**: Maintains a complete history of transaction status changes with reasons.
- **Blockchain Transaction Tracking**: Links on-chain transactions with internal ledger transactions.

#### Regulatory Compliance Framework

The system includes features to ensure compliance with financial regulations:

- **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)**: Risk scoring, screening results, and large transaction flagging.
- **Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)**: Tracks authentication methods and results for PSD2/PSD3 compliance.
- **Instant Payments**: Supports instant payment schemes with confirmation of payee functionality.
- **EU Regulations**: Designed for PSD3 and EU Instant Payments Regulation 2024/886 compliance.
- **Spanish Tax Reporting**: Includes fields for Spanish tax codes and reporting requirements.
- **Crypto Compliance**: Includes crypto-specific compliance checks and risk scoring for blockchain addresses.

#### Transaction Categorization System

Enables classification and organization of transactions for reporting and analysis:

- **External Category Management**: Transaction categories are now managed in an external master data microservice, with the transaction_category_id field serving as a logical reference to categories in this external service.

- **Transaction to Transaction Attachments**: One-to-many relationship. A transaction can have multiple supporting documents attached.

- **Transaction to Transaction**: Self-referential relationship. A transaction can be related to another transaction (e.g., a reversal transaction references the original transaction).

#### Blockchain & Crypto Relationships

- **Transaction to Blockchain Network**: Many-to-one relationship. A cryptocurrency transaction is associated with a specific blockchain network.

- **Transaction to Transaction Line Crypto**: One-to-one relationship. A cryptocurrency transaction has one specialized crypto transaction line.

- **Transaction Line Crypto to Crypto Asset**: Many-to-one relationship. A crypto transaction line references a specific crypto asset.

- **Crypto Asset to Blockchain Network**: Many-to-one relationship. A crypto asset belongs to a specific blockchain network.

- **Crypto Asset to NFT Metadata**: One-to-many relationship. An NFT crypto asset can have multiple token instances, each with its own metadata.

- **Money to Crypto Asset**: Many-to-one relationship. A money value can reference a specific crypto asset when representing cryptocurrency amounts.
